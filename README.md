# Plexus P/20 and P/15 Multi User UNIX server information repository 
I have a Plexus P/20 machine on the bench so I'm going to try to discover everything I can about how it works. There will be videos about the machine on my channel and I will upload binaries, docs and images to this repo.

Plexus was a California based company that was making UNIX server from around 1980 to 1988. The number of machines sold is eastimated to be about 2,500 globally across all model lines. The P/15 and P/20 seen on my channel is their low-end (8 or 16 user) machine designed to compete with more inexpensive UNIX systems. 

We have a discussion happening on Discord around this machine: https://discord.gg/hyrhQqWh
