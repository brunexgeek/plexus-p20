In the 1.1 release document we tell the user to position to file 21
on a cartridge by reading:
	for i in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20; do
		dd if=/dev/rmt0 bs=60b of=/dev/null
	done
However, i think that, when you are reading a file from cartridge, that
if you try to read more blocks than are in the file (or remain unread
after you have done one or more reads), the cartridge driver will read
data from the NEXT file.  I experienced this on an old SYS3 1.1 prerelease
version and I suspect it is the same for the most current 1.1 release.
Can you confirm this?  If true, we must be sure that the above method
of positioning to file 21 will work!!
