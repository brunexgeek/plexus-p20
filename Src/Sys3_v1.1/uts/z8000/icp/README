This is an attempt to bring some order to the proliferating `#ifdefs' that
seem to have infected the icp code. The following is a list of ifdefs and
what they do (or once did):

VPR	-	This cause the pio driver to use a larger buffer (512) instead
		of the old  256 char buffer. It may be used with the 1.0
		version kernel. However the reverse will cause the ICP to
		reject the request. At a future date, this may be incorporated
		into the ICP code as a permanent feature. Also note that there
		is a corresponding flag in the io driver for the ICP (si.c)
		that must be also evoked if the enhanced parallel port is to
		be used. Historical note: this was added to improve the
		Versatec throughput.

VPMSYS	-	This causes the Virtual Protocol code to be compiled.  This is
		a 'global' ifdef which controls 'sub' ifdefs.  This is on the
		UNIX and ICP sides.

VPMICP	-	This is again related to the Virtual Protocol code.  This 
		causes several 'lcb' structures to be enlarged for VPM.  This 
		is on the UNIX and ICP sides.

VPMSYSIS - 	This ifdef is related to the UNIX side.  This causes the 
		IMSC UNIX driver to NOT be compiled and the IS driver to be
		compiled.

VPMSYSIMSC -	This ifdef is related to the UNIX side.  This causes the 
		IS UNIX driver to be compiled and the IMSC driver to NOT be
		compiled.
