Herein is a simplified version of libc.a for standalone programs.
C programs that run under UNIX can be run standalone by compiling
the C source with scc in lieu of cc.  Scc is the standalone compiler that
"pulls in" lib2.a rather than libc.a.  The following programming 
restrictions must be observed:

argv, argc	No arguments are passed to the program.  Use getargv()
		within lib2.a.  See ls.c for example.

special files	Those of the standard system are not supported.
		Lib2.a has its own set of special files.

gtty()
stty()
ioctl()		Not fully supported.

signals		Not implemented.

>, <, ^		Redirection of I/O, pipes not possible on command lines.

sync()		Not supported

creat()		Same as an open for writing;  file must exist.

write()		Cannot write regular files; special (dkxx) files are okay.

setbuf()	Do not do setbuf(stdin,NULL) prior to getargv().

file desc.	File descriptors 0, 1, 2 always refer to console.

tape i/o	programs that read tape in blocks smaller that the
		size of the records on the tape fail and produce
		tape driver messages.

CHANGES TO lib2 THAT YOU SHOULD LOOK FOR WHEN CONVERTING V7 STANDALONE
PROGRAMS TO SYS3 STANDALONE

use of io array changed.

the getc/getw subroutines expects a stream pointer in Sys3.  V7 used file
descriptor.
