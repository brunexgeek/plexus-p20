order.in	03/09/82 JSE	renamed frexp11.o,modf11.o,ldexp11.o to
				Plexus versions (frexp.o,modf11.o,ldexp11.o).

order.out	03/09/82 JSE	removed all lines with fltused.o

order.in
order.out
libc.rc		04/21/82 JSE	Removed all reference to _fprint.o within
				order.in and order.out.  Also
				placed _print.o after _fprint.o in libc.a. 
				_print.o does the formatting for printf but
				does no f.p. output (%e %f %g).  
				_fprint.o, also in libc.a, is same but
				 has the f.p. stuff.

gen/mktemp.c	08/24/82 CCF	If the file name wasn't terminated by an X,
				it blew away the NULL at the end.  Fixed
				so that it puts an X at the end.
