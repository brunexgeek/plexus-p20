math.h		03/26/82 JSE	Added declaration of modf() and frexp()
				and redefined HUGE to reflect precision
				and range ieee doubles.
				Changes were done for V7.

syscall.h	03/03/82 JSE	Created from P-V7 syscall.h.  Added entries
				for ULIMIT, FCNTL and UNAME.  Removed FTIME,
				PHYS, MPX, and LOCK entries.
				Tentatively removed FCTNL define.

sys.s		03/03/82 JSE	Removed from Plexus R-III.  I think syscall.h
				supplants it.

syscall.h	03/04/82 JSE	Renamed UNAME syscall to PWBSYS.

plexus.h	03/08/82 JSE	Copied /usr/include/sys/plexus.h as is.

plexus.h	03/15/82 JSE	Linked /p3/usr/include/sys/plexus with
				/p3/usr/include/plexus.h

dumprestor.h	04/30/82 JSE	Changed NTREC from 20 to 10 because dump
				is too big to run otherwise; also, dump/restor
				do tape i/o in chunks of NTREC*BSIZE bytes and
				we increased BSIZE from 512 to 1024.
