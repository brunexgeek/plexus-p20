bs		02/28/82 CCF	bs.c needs FIFO files to compile

*.rc		03/11/82 JSE	fixed to use $INCLUDE, $UBIN 
				$CFLAGS and $LDFLAGS variables.

install.sh	03/12/82 JSE	Renamed stock version to r.install.sh and
				added LOOKDIR and DESTDIR shell variables
				to local copy.

awk		03/18/82 JSE	Uses fcntl; will not work under V7.
				Compiled and installed in /p3/usr/bin.

arcv6		03/18/82 JSE	Copied Plexus-V7 version.

init.mk
login.mk
sysfix.mk	03/18/82 JSE	Added CFLAGS = -O. Was part of LDFLAGS.

sum.c
cu.c		03/19/82 JSE	Added #define void int.  Should be removed
				when new compiler added.

getty.c		03/19/82 JSE	Requires change to read console switch
				registers.  Will install later.

ncheck.mk	03/22/82 JSE	Preceded if statement with - to ignore errors.

sysfix.mk	03/22/82 JSE	Commented out a line to work.  Try again
				with R-III make and sh.


date.c		03/22/82 JSE	Changed array declaration of month and
				days to have 2nd subscript of 4.  Original
				had 3.

bs/bs.mk
cref/cref.mk
dc/dc.mk
ed/ed.mk
efl/efl.mk	03/22/82 JSE	Added INCLUDE, CFLAG and LDFLAGS where
				appropriate, commented out "set +e; if"
				constructs where appropriate.  Restore
				latter when new shell done.

ld.mk
cp.mk
ld.mk
mv.mk
lint/lint.mk
cref/cref.mk
ed/ed.mk	03/22/82 JSE	Uses explicit references to object
				that may require attention if object
				is ever copied to other than root.

crash
config		03/22/82 JSE	Will require change/thought. Postpone.

ed/ed.mk	03/23/82 JSE	Added -DPWB to cc of ed.c.  Turns on
				fspec(5) capability.  Would not compile
				otherwise.  Probably should be disabled
				completely: it enlarges ed a bit.

dc		03/23/82 JSE	Compiled & installed w/o optimizing code:
				compiler optimizer ran "out of space".

efl/efl.mk	03/23/82 JSE	Added $(IFLAG) to the ld of efl.  It runs
				out of text space otherwise.
				Due to space overflow, cannot compile
				code with optimizer.  Unfortunately this
				causes a text space overflow.  Do later
				with new compiler or when time allows selective
				cc -O of efl source files.
f77/pdp11/Makefile
		03/23/82 JSE	commented out a set +e if" command.  Restore
				when R-III make and shell are installed.

lex/lex.mk
m4/m4.mk	03/23/82	Removed -n and -s arguments to cc. With lex,
				commented out the itest command.  Restore
				when R-III make/if/shell are available.
				Also lex, changed install to /etc/install.

make/make.mk	03/23/82	Set MARKFILE =  to null

profiler/profiler.mk
		03/23/82 JSE	Added $LDFLAG.  References /etc/ in some
				cp and chmod commands. Added rm -f *.o.

profiler/pdp11/prfld.c
		03/23/82 JSE	Added UNIXNAME.  Also, may have same byte
				swap problem ld has.

sa/sa.mk	03/23/82 JSE	Added LDFLAGS.

sed/sed/mk	03/23/82 JSE	removed -n -s args to cc

sh/sh.mk	03/23/82 JSE	Has explicit references to /bin in some
				mv, ln commands.

sccs/sccs.mk	03/24/82 JSE	Added $LDFLAGS.  Makes explicit reference
				to /usr/bin and /usr/lib/help via make var.

sno/sno.mk	03/24/82 JSE	Removed -s flag from cc.

spell/spell.mk	03/24/82 JSE	Added LDFLAGS; changed @if statements to
				-if because make aborts otherwise. Refers
				to several object directories via chgrp,
				chmod and mkdir commands.

text/text.mk
text/*/*.mk	03/24/82 JSE	For the various make files I added LDFLAGS
				and SL variables where appropriate so that
				their values are propagated to all make files
				when they are called by text.mk, the driver
				make file. I also changed all refernces of
				the kind "@if" to "-if" because make conks
				out always on the former.  Could be a return
				code problem with if.  Finally, text.mk
				uses object and source directories in cp,
				chgrp, and mkdir commands.

text/macros.d/macrunch
		03/25/82 JSE	A shell file with comments beginning with
				#.  Replaced with : .

tp/tp.mk
tplot/tplot.mk	03/25/82 JSE	removed -s flag from cc

typo/typo.mk	03/25/82 JSE	removed -s flag from cc, changed "@if"
				to "-if", added LDFLAGS.
				Has /usr and /usr/src/cmd hardwired.

uucp/uucp.mk	03/25/82 JSE	Has /bin and other destination dirs hardwired.

uucp/ulock.c	03/25/82 JSE	Two routines used time() sys call. One declared
				it as a long time(); the other did not;  cc
				said time() was redefined: I added declaration
				to the routine missing it.

yacc/yacc.mk	03/25/82 JSE	changed "@if" to "-if"; removed -s flag to cc.

MM macros	03/26/82 JSE	Did not "compile": required R-III nroff which
				requires R-III include files (termio.h,ioctl.h).

				not required for 1.0.

as		03/26/82 JSE	Will use V7 as.

cc		03/26/82 JSE	Did not attempt to compile: CCF will do.

adb		03/29/82 JSE	Did not attempt.  Massive changes, do later.

ld/ld		03/29/82 JSE	Put same changes in that were done to
				Plexus V7 version, viz., variables used
				for sizes of text, data, & bss were made
				unsigned; beginning of data differed
				because of page size differences; stamp
				variables were made unsigned.
				R-III version is ignorant of SYMDEF
				symbol table.

ld.z8000.c	03/29/82 JSE	Named our version of ld to ld.z8000.c
				(modified ld.pdp.c); chged ld.mk accordingly.


sdiff.c		03/19/82 JSE	The V7 compiler optimizer generates bad
				assembly code for this.  Problem can be
				isolated to cmdin() routines.  I suspect
				a bug in optimizer.  Compiled & installed
				w/o -O switch.

lint/lerror.h
lint/lerror2.c
lint/lerror.c	03/22/82 JSE	Compiling with V7 cc, the structure elements
				of crecord conflicted with those of hrecord,
				Also, c2record.number conflicted with like
				named element of crecord and hrecord.
				Changed references as follows:
				 crecord.* to crecord.*X 
				 c2record.number to c2record.numberY
				Restore when new compiler available.
				There are other conflicts.  Tentatively shelve.

ls.c		03/31/82 CCF	Fixed bug in gstat routine.

ps.c		03/31/82 JSE	Modified ps.c per V7 changes: 1) to use
				UNIXNAME, 2) to compute execution time based
				on 50 HZ clock, 3) to examine /dev/kmem rather
				than /dev/mem for value of kernal variables.
		04/17/82 JSE	Changed to use /dev/mem for user process data.

dump.c		03/31/82 JSE	modified per V7 changes: 1) changed default

				message, 4) check for BIGBLK in bread.

				tape to /dev/rmt0, 2) added standalone message.

clri.c		04/01/82 JSE	Copied Plexus V7 version with BIGBLK changes.

fgrep.c		04/01/82 JSE	Added bstart variable to cfail() routine as
				done in V7 addenda.  The fix was not incor-
				porated in R-III.

ncheck.c	04/01/82 JSE	Changed HSIZE variable for BIGBLK's per Plexus
				V7 change.

time.c		04/01/82 JSE	Per Plexus V7, converted times from 50 to 60 
				Hz. for printout.  Added <sys/times.h> to
				reference cv50to60() declarartion.

stty.c		04/02/82 JSE	Per Plexus V7, defined "exta" to be 19200
				and added printf's for "extb" speed.

getty.c		04/02/82 JSE	Added table entry for "extb" speed so that
				it recogizes 'b' for the type argument.

tar.c		04/02/82 JSE	Per Plexus V7, changed default drive to 0 and
				fixed bug whereby tar did not close special
				files that it opens.

fsck.c		04/02/82 CCF	Added line so that it knows that lseek returns
				a long value.  Fails miserably under sys unless
				this is done.

				accessed correctly.

awk/proc.c	04/05/82 JSE	Added exit(0) at end of main() per
				V7 addenda; ommitted from R-III

awk/run.c	04/05/82 JSE	Added following from V7 addenda; they were
				omitted from R-III, probably erroneously.
				1) format routine did not handle "%%" correctly
				2) added code to assign() routine to allow a
				   variable to be a string and number.  see
				   EXPLAIN file in awk directory.

				Converted times from 50 cycle/sec to 60.

fsdb.c		05/05/82 CCF	modified (~10 places) where BSIZE
				was tied to 512 via constants in the source
				code.  Also changed it so that /dev/dk??
				is used and PLEXUS SYS3 is mentioned instead
				of 11/70 UNIX.
