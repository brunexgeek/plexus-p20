     The following files are associated with the SCCS package in system 3.

	admin ----- crate and administer SCCS files.
	cdc ------- change the delta commentary of an SCCS delta.
	comb ------ combine SCCS deltas.
	delta ----- make a delta (change) to an SCCS file.
	get ------- get a version of an SCCS file.
	prs ------- print an SCCS file.
	rmdel ----- remove a delta from an SCCS file.
	sact ------ print current SCCS file editing activity
	sccsdiff -- compare two versions of an SCCS file
	unget ----- undo a previous get of an SCCS file.
	val ------- validate SCCS file.
	what ------ identify SCCS files.

     The following difficulties were encountered. (version 7)

          1. There is a new function available in libc: tzset() which
             is not found in Version 7. See ctime(3) for details.

          2. SCCS uses the libPW.a library from PWB unix. There is, however,
             no documentation of this library in the System 3 manual.

          3. Three include files were found to be different between System 3
             and Version 7. They are "fatal.h, macros.h, and misc.h".

     Solutions (sic).

          1. Included ctime(3) from system 3 and included it directly in the
             build of SCCS functions. (not done for system 3 releases).

          2. Built libPW from source. There are two routines that gave trouble:
             move.c and alloca.s. Both are routines optimized for the PDP-11.
             Simple and expedient measures were taken i.e. Move.c was written
             as a trivial function. Alloca() usage was programed arround by
             adding a local array of the proper type.

          3. The three different or missing include files were copied to the
             work area. (not done for system 3 releases).


	  4. Changed make file so that ld does not strip object. Added
	     -I/p3/usr/include.
