#	"@(#)c23FIX	1.1"
Following code changes were made to make c2 a little
more restrictive about tossing out the call to csv.

If a routine passes a couple of tests it is likely that all
computation can be performed in scratch registers and
csv need not be called.  The list of requirements included:
all local variables must be in registers,
no functions may be called (including implicit calls
like floating point add).
This code prevents functions which take the address of an argument
from being turned into no-csv functions.
A problem arises because without the call to csv r14 is not a valid
frame pointer. C2 must find all references to r14 and
change them to references to r15.  This is easy for normal argument
references since the indexed address mode is used and the offset
can easily be found and adjusted; with &arg, though, the
code generated is something like

		ld	r7, r14
		add	r7, $offset

the offset which must be adjusted may be an instruction or two ahead of
or after the reference to r14.
