try doing long/unsigned_short
	fixed:	extends for div based on resultant type

wants a dummy .globl for static procedures
	fixed: puts null .globl

register i;i++;
	this causes 'ld r7,r13'
	if 'i' is on the stack it doesn't happen, the production
	"26-" removes it.  "26-" doesn't account for registers.
	i'm afraid to make the fix and include regs.  must try the
	stock compiler and see what is does.

char *foo();
main(){
	0 > foo(); /* since foo is a pointer it can never be true 
			the compiler therefor doesn't call foo.  I
			suppose it should for the side effects of the
			call?? */
