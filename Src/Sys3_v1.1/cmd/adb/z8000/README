This is a new version of adb (circa Aug 24 1982). In incorporates several
improvements and bug fixes. There are as follows:

	1. Necessary changes to make adb work with overlay kernel. These
	   changes are ifdef'ed out with the variable "OVKRNL". They are
	   normally disabled. The file /bin/oadb is the overlay version of
	   this copy of adb.

	2. <name>:e is an extension of :e . It provides the capability to
	   break point after a function name that occurs in the run time
	   stack. Use $c or $C to determine the active functions.

	3. fcpd & fnegd now disassemble properly.

	4. ldar problem fixed.

	5. Priveleged instructions are now disassembled (ei, di, halt, etc.).

	6. There was a problem with $c & $C giving the illusion of too few
	   procedure paramaters.

	7. A switch has been added to cause the initial default integer base to
	   be hexadecimal. Use adb -x ~~~~ .

	8. $x should print everything in hex. $o formats have been modified for
	   large integers (they were colliding).

	9. I/O has been upgraded to System III ioctl().
