:mkcmd		03/11/82 JSE	Added comments. Removed /bin/pdp11
				/bin/vax references.  Added INCLUDE
				and LIB shell variables and passed
				them on to all *.mk and *.rc files
				:mkcmd calls.  Not all of the *.mk
				and *.rc files use them, however.
				Fixed bug in make of
				directory-commands having to do with -f
				option.
				Added YACCLIB, LINLIB, LIB, LDFLAGS
				variables.  Fixed so that ldflags can
				be set for all commands with LDFILE
				overriding it for only those commands
				listed in it.  Before, an unlisted file
				resulted in ldflags being set to null.
				Added ETC and file.etc capability.

ldflags		03/18/82 JSE	Added init, sysfix. Removed echo.
				Removed -f flag from units, spline, pack.
				Added ncheck to list.

:mkuts		05/18/82 JSE	Defined default values for the variables,
				REL, VER, SYS, NODE, and ROOT.
