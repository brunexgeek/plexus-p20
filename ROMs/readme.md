# Dumps of ROM chips on the Plexus P/20

The system has two pairs of ROM chips on the main motherboard. (High and low byte for the 16bit databus)

All of the motherboard ROMs are used by the DMA processor (top 68010 on the motherboard) to boot the system. 

The locations on the maimboard are U15 and U17 (Originally incorrectly identified as U17 and U19. U17 became U15 and U19 became U17, the correct locations on the mainboard.)
