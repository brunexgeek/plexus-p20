Hitting <DEL> which is Control-? DEC 127 after power on gets you into this dma> diag mode.

t -> run all tests
h -> lists all test
tX -> run a specific test number
q -> show system configuration

I -> prints 0 = 0? Hitting enter just displays 1 = 0? and so on. Hitting Q exits back to DMA. This seems to be examining some other part of RAM. SRAM perhaps? 
XI -> like I above, but takes a value, likely an address

i -> will print 0 = CO instead of 0. This seems to be talking abotu RAM see in with / command

S -> print "jumping to 0" and then seems to crash
XS -> where X is a number, will jump to that address
Z -> Really? (Y or N) [and choosing Y or N doesn't seem to do anything]
X -> seem to print the status of debugger (bunch of like CPU registers)
v -> prints "no boards"
V -> prints "VERSION = RD-32 06/04/85"
! -> exits to boot
/ -> allows you to examine and edit RAM
X/ -> where X is an address, examine directly that address
@ -> goes a newline and seems to allow you to enter multiple commands at once

L -> does nothing
XL Y -> where X is an address and Y is a value. Seems to result in these DMA address RECEIVED 0 EXOECTED Y 


T -> does nothing
w -> does nothing
W -> does nothing
o -> does nothing
O -> does nothing
s -> does nothing
g -> does nothing

" -> does nothing
m -> does nothing
M -> does nothing

Q H e E r R y Y u U p P d D f F G -> prints ????
[ { ] } \ | ; : ' , < . > - _ = + ? # % ^ & ( ) -> prints ????
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0  -> prints ????
j J k K l z x c C b B n N -> prints ????
