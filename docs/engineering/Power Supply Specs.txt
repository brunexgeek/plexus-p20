	Peak current is used on +12V to start motors on disk drives.  The
supply must be capable of supplying max current for a 60 second period
after turn on at max rated temperature.  Drawing peak current beyond 60
seconds must not damage the supply but may cause the supply to shut down.

	The supplies must meet the specified output regulation down to the
specified minimum currents.  When no current is drawn from amy output, the
12 Volt outputs must not exceed 13.5 Volts, and the 5 Volt output must not
exceed 5.5 Volts.

	The two supplies are to be connected to a combination of loads
which share a common ground connection.  The main supply is to power the
main logic board, up to two peripheral controller boards, and two drives
(tape/winchester or floppy/winchester).  The auxiliary supply is to power
one peripheral controller, one drive, and/or up to three logic boards
through a backplane.  The main logic board ground connects to the backplane
ground and to the peripheral controller grounds.  The peripheral controller
grounds also connect to the drive grounds.  See the following diagram.

					 rated loads, all outputs
		     
		     Common mode noise should not exceed 10% when measured
		     from Earth to each output.

 Adjustments:        All factory preset and frozen

 Remote Sense:	     Not required.

 Holdup Time:        16 mSec after loss of nominal ac power at full load.
		     A missing half-cycle of nominal ac power at 47 Hz should
		     not cause any change in any outputs including Power Fail
		     Output.

 Efficiency:         Greater than 70% at full load with nominal ac input

 Operational Temp    Deliver rated output at 50 C with forced air cooling
		     (35 cfm)

 Regulatory:         Supply must be designed and manufactured to meet:

 		     Safety:   UL 478
			       CSA C22.2 #154
			       VDE 0806 and 0805
			       IEC 380 and IEC 435 Class I

			       Supplies will be initially submitted to VDE
			       0806 and IEC 380, but we anticipate submitting
			       them to 0805 and 435 in the future.

			       Must be encased in metal mesh to prevent
			       access to high voltages.

		     Emissions:  VDE 0871 Level A
			         FCC Part 15 subpart J Class A

 Mechanical Shock:   10 Gs operating, 20 Gs non operating

 Output protection:  Over voltage on +5V set to 6.2V +/- 0.4V

		     Over power each supply (125 - 150% of rated load)

		     Over temperature protection between 95 and 110 C

		     Both supplies shall shut down simultaneously (within
		     10 mSec) on fault conditions.

 Altitude:           Operating: 10,000 ft. Non operating: 40,000 ft.

 Storage Temp:       -55 C to +85 C

 MTBF:               30,000 Hour Minimum at max outputs and 35 C

 Relative Humidity:  5% to 95% (non condensing)

 Output Temp Coef:   .02% per degree C max on 5 Volt.
		     .05% per degree C max on +/- 12 Volt.

 Transient Response: Recovery to within 1% in less than 1.5 mSec.  Maximum
		     voltage is 5%.

 AC Input:           85 - 130/ 190 - 264 vac input
		     47 - 63 Hz
		     Max Irms at low voltage = 14A.
		     Input Surge Current (cold start) less than 50 Amp
		     total for both supplies.

Main Supply Features:
		     The main supply must include the following:

		     o  RFI line filtering for Fcc and VDE compliance
		     o  AC line cord receptacle
		     o  Fuse
		     o  120/240 line voltage selection switch
		     o  Reset input
		     o  Remote AC turn-on line
		     o  Power fail sense circuit
		     o  Expansion output for connection to auxiliary supply
			with noise immune control signals.
		     o  Fan output

 Power Fail Output:  Active at least 2 mSec before outputs go out of spec
		     (including outputs of secondary supply) due to brown
		     out or total loss of ac power.  Output valid when 
		     Reset output is inactive.

		     Active = 0 - .5 Volts at -2 mA
		     Inactive = 2.6 - 5 Volts (.5 mA at 2.6 V)

 Reset Output:       Output is always valid.  Output changes to its inactive
		     state when the Power Fail Output is inactive and all
		     outputs have been in regulation for 150 mSec minimum.
		     Outputs change to active when they become unregulated
		     (at least 2 mSec after Power Fail Output becomes active)
		     or when the reset input is active low.  Minimum active
		     pulse is 150 mSec.

		     Active = 0 - .8 Volts at -2 mA
		     Inactive = 2.6 - 5 Volts (3mA at 2.6 V)

 Remote turn on
 Line:		     The primary and secondary supply and fan must be turned
		     on when this line is connected to common.  The remote
		     turn on line must be isolated from primary circuitry.
		     When the supplies are shut off via this line, the
		     supplies should draw no more than 5 watts of AC power.

 RESET Input:        Asserts Reset Output to active state when connected to
		     Common.  This signal will be driven by a switch and must
		     be pulled up by a 300 ohm resistor to at least 5 volts and
		     not more than 12 volts.

 Fan Output:         115 vac 38 Watt at line frequency.  This output must
		     be switched by the remote turn on line.

 COMMON to EARTH:    Secondary COM (0 V dc) will be connected to EARTH
		     (green wire in the line cord) through a 100 ohm 5 watt
		     resistor in the primary supply.  COM and EARTH are not
		     to be connected in the auxiliary supply.

 Safety Shield:      All Main Supplies will be shipped with a dummy plug/
		     protective cover on P7 to protect personnel from the
		     300 Vdc lines.
